# Excel-Workbook-Splitter

designed to automate the process of generating separate workbooks from a single Excel workbook. It efficiently creates individual files for each worksheet, excluding the first one, and names them in a standardized format. This tool is particularly useful for organizing and sharing specific data segments without the need to manually copy and paste information.

What It Does
* Extracts Worksheets: Copies all worksheets from the main workbook, except for the first sheet.
* Creates Separate Workbooks: Generates individual workbooks for each of the selected worksheets.
* Standardized Naming: Names each new workbook with the format "Document Repository - [Worksheet Name]".
* Saves in Specified Location: Allows the user to define a folder path where the new workbooks will be saved.
